# Dotfiles

Repository for my [dotfiles](https://dotfiles.github.io/).

## Instalation

* Make sure the install script and other scripts are runnable:

    `sudo chmod -R +x scripts/* install.sh`

* Run :

    `./install.sh`

**Note:**  Currently this process copies the scripts to `$HOME/bin`. Make sure that location is already on your `PATH` to use the scripts as commands regardless of where you are.
